# Midterm

Can you believe we're already halfway through the semester?

My number one goal in this class is for everyone to walk away with something that they're excited to share. The class is structured (or not structured) so that you have plenty of time and space to follow your own interest and curiosity when it comes to sound design. The only exception is the midterm presentation, which is there to make sure that you're prepared for the final project.

## What to Present

A good way to conceptualize the midterm presentation is to imagine yourself giving a pitch to a client. Imagine you're working for a design studio, and you're trying to get someone to invest in you make something for them.
- Can you help them understand what you're trying to do?
- Will they see what's important or interesting about it?
- Are they convinced that you can actually pull it off?

A good midterm presentation should include the following:

- A high-level framing for your project as a whole. In one sentence, what are you going to do for the final? Even if you're not totally sure what technology you're going to use, or even whether you're building an instrument, an installation, or composing a piece, you should still be able to frame the project overall. Some examples:
  - I'm interested in exploring real-time performance using a game controller.
  - I want to design a web experience that teaches people about creative uses of the Fourier transform.
  - I want to build a tool that other musicians can use to make music, and then write a short piece as a demo.
  - I want to design my own synthesizer.
- A "why" statement for your work. Of all the things that you could have chosen to work on, why this? What about it is important to you?
- A brief survey of prior art that relates to and inspires your work.
- Sketches of the visual elements of your piece. If you're building an installation, what will it look like? If you're designing a tool, how will it be laid out? It doesn't have to be fine art, but it should give us an idea of the direction that you want to go in.
- An outline of the tech stack that you plan to use. If some parts are still undecided, what could they be? What will help you make a decision one way or another?
- If you have the chance, a short demo or proof-of-concept. While this isn't a hard requirement, it is strongly encouraged.
- Another thing that's not required but definitely recommended: a schedule. If your work has phases, for example finalizing your tech stack before beginning other work, when do you expect that piece to be completed? If you're relying on something from the outside, maybe getting circuit boards printed or getting parts delivered, by when do you need those parts ready to be finished in time for the final?

## Final Requirements

As for the final itself, the requirements are fairly loose. Just like the in-class crits, the only hard requirement is that interaction with sound be at the heart of the work.

- The project must involve interaction with sound in some way. That could be a real-time interaction, like an interactive installation, or a performance using a controller that you build. It could also involve an interaction that happens offline, before the work itself. So if you create a sound design tool, you could present a demo of the tool itself. The only thing that really wouldn't fit would be a static piece of music, written without using any tools that you made yourself.
- Unlike the in-class crits, you may work in teams of any size. Of course, if you do, everyone should have a clear role, and the scope of the project should reflect a group effort. 
- As ever, you do not have to use Max.

## Venue

We could just do the final presentations in the classroom itself. However! Wouldn't it be fun to do it in another room? Part of the value of doing these midterm presentations before the final, it gives me a chance to see if we need another venue. Maybe we can make it into a bit of a concert? We'll see.

## What if I change my mind?

"What if I say my final is going to be about building a patch with a game controller, but then I change my mind and do an installation instead?" That's okay. The midterm is about being prepared, and about getting in the head space for the final. We might want to sync up quickly over office hours, however, just to make sure the project is still in scope.

## Ideas and Inspiration

This section is just the same as in [in-class-presentations](./IN-CLASS-PRESENTATIONS.md), but I've included it here since it's still useful.

When it comes to getting inspired, it's hard to give a clear answer that will work for everyone. Some people are inspired by other artwork that they see, and they keep a scrapbook (literal, digital, or mental) of work that they want to emulate. Some people find a particular emotion or memory that they want to express, and art is a way to work through that expression. For me, curiosity for sound is the key. When I was first studying Max, I would keep a diary of ideas that would come to me after each lesson. A lecture would present an idea, and usually that would be a good for a handful of interesting possibilities for me to explore, of fun questions for me to try to answer. We'd see a presentation on how to play a sound, and I'd want to know "what does it sound like to play 1000 sounds at the same time?" The next week we'd talk about how to use a game controller as an input device, and I'd ask myself if you could use a [guitar hero controller to do real improvisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqdOI2bgbBM).
