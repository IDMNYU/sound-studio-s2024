# In-Class Crit Presentations

This is a studio class, and I take that description literally: it's not a lecture, but rather a space for the pursuit of study. You should feel free to pursue your own study at a depth or bredth that matches your interest in sound and your learning goals for yourself. In order to structure that study, I'm requiring that everyone submit work to an in-class crit at least twice this semester. We'll reserve time at the end of every class for at least two students to present something that they're working on, and for the rest of us to offer our constructive critique.

## What to Present

The overall scope for what you present in class is very broad, but there are some hard requirements. First, it must be a project involving interactive sound in one form or another. You can submit static compositions, but those compositions should be generated from an interactive process. For example, you could build your own instrument or create your own sound design tool, and then record the output of working with what you've made. Second, it must involve original work for this class. It can be inspired by work that you're doing for another class, and you can use the work that you do in this class for other projects. For example, I don't mind if you create something in this class that you use to do sound design for a video game class. However, you must do original work for this class and you cannot re-use work from another class or project. Finally, you should do the work on your own. Although it's fine if the two in-class crit presentations that you do are building towards your final project, and it's fine if you work in teams for the final project, the work that you do for the in-class presentations should be your own.

Overall, the kinds of projects that you present for these crits is the same as what you should present for the final project. This is part of why I think it's totally valid to use these as an opportunity to build towards the final piece. However, it's also a chance to explore a kind of minitature version of something interesting that might be new to you. Maybe you've never tried physical computing before—try taking a single bend sensor and see if you can write a piece of music with it. Maybe you've never done sound design for the web—try to make a small p5.js sketch with a dynamic sound component. 

It is not required that you use Max, but you're welcome to.

## Giving Crit

Since we're reserving class time to talk about each other's work, it means that participating in crit is part of your grade for this course. Even when you're watching someone else present on their project, you should be listening actively and thinking about what you're seeing. It's time for you to hone your critical sense of technology-driven artwork. You should be paying attention to the material properties of each piece you see. What media is the presenter working with? Why did they choose those materials? How does that choice affect the piece, and the audience's experience? What other work does it remind you of? What themes or traditions is the artist working with? Remember too that crit is vulnerable, and be respectful of the work that someone else has put into their project. However, don't be afraid to point out something that could use improvement, especially if the presenter has asked specifically for input in that area.

## Ideas and Inspiration

When it comes to getting inspired, it's hard to give a clear answer that will work for everyone. Some people are inspired by other artwork that they see, and they keep a scrapbook (literal, digital, or mental) of work that they want to emulate. Some people find a particular emotion or memory that they want to express, and art is a way to work through that expression. For me, curiosity for sound is the key. When I was first studying Max, I would keep a diary of ideas that would come to me after each lesson. A lecture would present an idea, and usually that would be a good for a handful of interesting possibilities for me to explore, of fun questions for me to try to answer. We'd see a presentation on how to play a sound, and I'd want to know "what does it sound like to play 1000 sounds at the same time?" The next week we'd talk about how to use a game controller as an input device, and I'd ask myself if you could use a [guitar hero controller to do real improvisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqdOI2bgbBM).
