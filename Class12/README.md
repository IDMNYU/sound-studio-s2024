## Topics
- Granular Synthesis

## Themes
- Extreme time stretching

## Lecture

### Granular Synthesis
- Listen to some Barry Truax pieces.
- Build a basic granular synthesis patch
- We don't really need to use it since there's already a granulator object in rnbo~
- Lots to experiment with

### VOSIM
- Special application of granular synthesis

## Lab
- Take one of the patches we looked at, maybe the granular synthesis patch, one of the MC patches, or the vosim patch, and try to map some controls to it. See if you can control that patch in a music way. Remember what we talked about in terms of best practices for controlling a patch like this.
