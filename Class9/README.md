### Lab
- Option 1: Listen to Mini Metro. Try to recreate the composition using components from Upshot
- Option 2: Using the control mechanisms that we've looked at in class so far (key/keyup, mousestate, midiin/midiout, and gamepad), can you turn one of the examples into something that you can control? Can you make a short composition by adding control on top of one of the examples?
- Option 3: Go off on your own, explore the package, and try to make your own generative moment using Upshot.
