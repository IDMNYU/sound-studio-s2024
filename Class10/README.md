### Envelope Following

- Simple example of feature extraction
- Demonstrate "pumping" when using a compressor with a sidechain

### pattr

- Super quick introduction to the system
- How to use it in most patches

### Onset Detection

- Briefly chat about timbral measurements.
- Interesting both for "online" and "offline" work.
- Offline: quickly build up a big sample library that you can work with.
- Online (streaming): resample some kind of music in real time.
