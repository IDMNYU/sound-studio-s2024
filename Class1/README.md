# Class 1

Hi welcome to class 1. 

In this class we're going to talk about theory, but theory isn't the most important thing. We're going to listen to some art, but art isn't the most important thing. We're going to look at some technical stuff, but the technical parts aren't the most important thing either. The most important thing is actually the synthesis of all these parts. I really want to put the strongest emphasis in this class on making stuff. For that reason, we're going to devote the second half of each class (except for the first class) to sharing work that we've made. In each class, two students will be responsible for bringing something that they've worked on. That something can be a composition. It can be a website. It can be a really interesting sound. It can be an audio plugin. This is very much a self-driven class, and you'll get as much out of it as you put into it. 

## Technologies
- Max
- Supercollider
- Web Audio
- WASM
- Audio Plugins (VSTs)
- JUCE
- Raspberry Pi
- Arduino
- Rebel Pedals
- Command Line
- Git/Github
- Ableton Live
- Max for Live

## Using Max

- In Max, everything is objects and messages. Objects send messages to each other, and when they receive messages, they change their behavior in some way. 
- Lock and Unlock--how you interact with the patch depends on the state of the patch.
- Open the inspector to look at the configuration of an object
- Open a help patcher to see how an object works. You can unlock and copy-paste a help patcher
- Open the console to see messages from Max. If something isn't working, this is the first place to look. You can double-click on an error message to see the object that produced the message.

- Simple objects are ones like bang, toggle, metro. You can use these to make very simple noisemakers.
- With a slider and a metro, you can make a small kind of soundmaking toy.
- You can record your output with `quickrecord`
